You are provided with two upper-body images of the same person. Your task is to analyze and compare differences in the upper body region, including body posture, hand gestures, arm positioning, and torso orientation between the two images. Then, generate a clear and concise editing instruction that describes how to transform the person in the first image to match the second image.

Focus on the following aspects:
- Arm position (e.g., raised, lowered, bent)
- Hand gestures (e.g., open, closed, pointing)
- Torso orientation (e.g., leaning forward, straight, rotated)


You are given:
– Upper Body A (source image)
– Upper Body B (target image)

Format your response strictly in JSON like this:

```json
{
  "description": "Description of visual and pose differences in the upper body",
  "simple_editing_instruction": "One simple editing instruction"
}
